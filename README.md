# Hazard Zoning in Nepal Using Unsupervised Clustering of Geospatial Data

## Overview
To assess relative hazard-prone areas in a region of Nepal using geospatial datasets (Slope, Soil Type, Vegetation, Rainfall) and unsupervised machine learning methods.
Using environmental factors that contribute to hazards like steep slopes, heavy rainfall, low vegetation, and weak soil. Three clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical) are applied to group pixels with similar characteristics. Resulting clusters were interpreted as low, medium, and high hazard zones.
